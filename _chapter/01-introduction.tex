\textcite{goldinGrandGenderConvergence2014a} highlights the need to look within occupations
to understand how jobs are organized and compensated and how this might diferentially affect men and
women. 

A commonly used measure to summarize differences in the distribution of women and men across occupation categories 
is the index of segregation developed by Duncan (1955). 

The index of occupational segregation by sex is computed as

\begin{equation}
    D = 0.5 \sum_j |M_j - F_j|,
\end{equation}

where $M_j$ ($F_j$) is the fraction of all employed males (females) who work in occupation $j$. 
The index, which ranges between zero and one, indicates the proportion of women or men that would need 
to change occupations for the occupational distribution of men and women to be the same. In other words, 
if the distribution of men and women across occupational categories were identical (complete integration), 
the segregation index would equal zero. If all the occupations were either completely male or completely female 
(complete segregation), the segregation index would equal one.
